### **Product name (generic): “State Integrity Auditor”**

A read-only service that continuously verifies that **distributed systems agree on shared truth** — users, subscriptions, permissions, alerts, payments, etc.

It sits *outside* your stack and answers:

> “Are all our systems talking about the same reality?”

## 🎯 Who Needs It

These are the industries and situations where “undefined states” and sync mismatches cost real money or risk:

| Segment                              | Why they need it                                       | Example pain                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SaaS with legacy + microservices** | Rapid growth created overlapping schemas               | Billing says active, product says inactive                    |
| **Fintech / Insurtech**              | Compliance requires consistent ledgers                 | Transaction confirmed in ledger A, pending in ledger B        |
| **Healthcare tech**                  | HIPAA + audit trails demand one source of truth        | Patient discharged in one system, still “admitted” in another |
| **Logistics / Dispatch / IoT**       | Devices report inconsistent states                     | Vehicle marked “idle” on map but “in service” in dispatch     |
| **Subscription businesses**          | Customer lifecycle spread across CRM + billing + usage | Customer canceled but still billed                            |
| **Government / Public safety**       | Multi-system coordination under audit                  | Alert sent but not logged as delivered                        |

Anywhere multiple data stores exist without a single authoritative model, this sells.

## 💡 Positioning

Not DevEx.
Not observability.
Not BI.

> It’s **Data Truth Assurance** — verifying that what you *believe* is happening in production is *actually* happening.

---

## 🧩 Core Value Props

1. **Cross-system consistency validation** (DBs, APIs, message queues)
2. **Rule-based invariants** (`no orphaned subscriptions`, `no conflicting ownership`)
3. **Autogenerated data glossary** (explains what each table/entity means)
4. **Compliance evidence** (signed reports + historical trend of violations)
5. **Low risk / read-only integration**

---

## 🏗️ Architecture (SaaS version)

1. **Connectors** → Postgres, MySQL, Mongo, REST, S3, Kafka, etc.
2. **Rule engine** → YAML or DSL defining invariants.
3. **Scheduler** → Cron/CI/Cloud run every N hours.
4. **Result store** → append-only “audit ledger.”
5. **Frontend** → “truth map” dashboard + PDF reports.

Users write small declarative checks; system runs them and reports diffs.

## 💰 Monetization

| Tier       | Target                               | Pricing Model                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Starter    | Small SaaS, single DB pair           | $99/mo per environment          |
| Growth     | Multi-service org                    | $499–999/mo + per-check pricing |
| Enterprise | Regulated (Fintech, Healthcare, Gov) | Custom + audit SLA reports      |

Optional: “Integrity Report” consulting add-on.

## 🔗 Competitive Positioning

* **Not** DataDog / Honeycomb / Grafana → those monitor metrics/logs, not logical consistency.
* **Not** dbt tests → dbt is for analytics pipelines, not live app states.
* **Closest analog:** Metaplane, Monte Carlo, Bigeye — but they’re *data-observability for warehouses*, not for operational systems.
  → Your niche: **operational data correctness** (OLTP consistency).

---

## ⚙️ Roadmap

**MVP (6 weeks):**

* 3 connectors (Postgres, MySQL, REST).
* 1 rule language (YAML).
* CLI + hosted report UI.

**Beta (3 months):**

* Slack/email alerts.
* Config templates by industry (“subscription sanity,” “dispatch routing”).
* Org dashboard.

**Full SaaS (6–9 months):**

* Multi-tenant accounts.
* Rule-sharing community.
* SOC2 + audit report generation.

## 🧠 One-liner for investors or customers

> “We verify that your distributed systems agree on what’s true — before your customers or auditors find out they don’t.”

In short: what you described isn’t a niche tool for Active911 — it’s the seed of a new class of reliability product: **cross-system state integrity assurance.**
Active911 just happens to be your **first ideal case study** to validate it.
