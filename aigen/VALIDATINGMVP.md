Now you’ve got a prototype that can catch contradictions between systems. That’s valuable, but it’s abstract.
Now you need **proof of pain, proof of value, and proof of repeatability.**
Everything else (branding, fundraising, scaling) comes *after* those three.

---

## **1. Choose your test market**

Don’t chase “every business with data.” Pick one vertical where:

* you already know the jargon,
* mistakes are expensive,
* and data flows between 2–4 systems regularly.

You already have credibility in **public safety SaaS**, but for expansion, the easiest adjacent verticals are:

* **Healthcare SaaS** (patient or record sync),
* **Fleet / logistics platforms**,
* **Billing / subscription platforms.**

Pick one. One only. You’re not selling an integrity tool — you’re selling **peace of mind in a high-risk domain**.

---

## **2. Prove the pain**

Go talk to 10 people in that vertical.
Ask only these:

1. “When was the last time your systems disagreed about what’s true?”
2. “How did you discover it?”
3. “What did it cost you?”

If they don’t wince when answering #3, they’re not your customer.
You’re looking for *visceral discomfort*. Document those stories — they’ll become your pitch.

---

## **3. Deploy your MVP as a service, not a product**

Forget dashboards and SaaS logins right now. Offer it like this:

> “I’ll plug into your staging DBs and APIs, run 10 consistency checks, and deliver a signed report of every data mismatch that could cost you money.”

Deliver as a **PDF + CSV**. Charge for it — even $300.
You’re selling *results*, not software yet.

If they pay once and ask for it monthly, congrats — you’ve found recurring value.

---

## **4. Turn patterns into reusable templates**

After 3–5 engagements:

* List the invariants that repeat (e.g. “user active here, inactive there”).
* Group them by vertical.
  Those become your “templates.”

Now your pitch changes from “we’ll write rules for you” →

> “We already have a consistency pack for fleet dispatch / healthcare scheduling / subscription SaaS.”

That’s when it starts scaling.

---

## **5. Tighten feedback loops**

After each client:

* Record how long setup took.
* Record how long until first useful result.
* Record what phrasing triggered “wow.”
  Cut anything that doesn’t lead directly to that moment.

When setup <30min and “wow” happens within a day, you’ve got product–market fit signals.

---

## **6. Decide your next fork**

Once 3 paying customers re-up, choose one:

* **Stay services-heavy:** keep it boutique, charge $2–5k/report, low volume, high margin.
* **Productize:** turn your engine + templates into a SaaS (self-serve rules, reports).

If you go product, your MVP already *is* the backend. You’ll just need:

* multi-tenant job queue,
* basic auth,
* and report viewer.

---

## **7. Keep your message disciplined**

Never say “developer tool,” “data observability,” or “DevEx.”
Say:

> “We catch the hidden data mismatches that cost your business money or compliance.”

That’s it. Everything else grows from that.

---

### **TL;DR**

Your MVP’s job isn’t to impress engineers — it’s to expose *revenue- or risk-critical contradictions* in real companies.
So:

1. Pick one high-stakes vertical.
2. Run it manually for a few early customers.
3. Deliver tangible reports they can’t get internally.
4. Charge.
5. Extract repeatable rules.
6. Automate.

Do that, and you’ll have the only product that sells **truth as a service.**
